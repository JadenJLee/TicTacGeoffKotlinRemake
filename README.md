# TicTacGeoffKotlinRemake

Hi everyone, my name is Jaden Lee and my partner was Neo Huang. 
Since kotlin is more or less (in my opinion) an updated version of Java, along with the help of a TA, 
we thought it was a good idea to revisit my project from CS125. 
The CS project was simple enough so that we don't struggle with it as newer programmers, 
but also challenging in learning how to convert Java code to Kotlin code, something Kotlin is going to see a lot of in the future.

The first challenge we encountered was dealing with different time zones and working with someone remotely. 
I am currently situated in South Korea whereas my partner was in the bay area of california. 
During this day and age where friends are accessible through video and screen sharing, 
I thought coding with a partner remotely was a valuable skill I learned during the process. 
I would often sort out some errors on my own computer alongside him and share my solutions with Neo. 
Communication was key to our ability to work efficiently.

Secondly, we ran into issues with nullability as it was slightly different than Java. 
Long story short, a lot of stack overflows later, we figured out how to debug our kotlin syntax errors.

Thirdly, we tried changing the Main file into Kotlin, but that essentially destroyed our entire project, 
and we couldn't figure out precisely why. 
We went through a lot of online resources (stack overflow lol) and other tutorials 
but I think this was a problem for later. 
It was a little bit harder than what our experience level was at (basically only CS125 and simple personal projects) 
but I want to be able to figure that out later after finals season.

Fourthly, it was just mostly cleaning up my CS125 project. 
Neo probably has more experience than I have so he had a headache just trying to figure out what my code was doing most of the time. 
A lot of the project is failed attempts at getting a camera API to work properly with the whole project, 
before scrapping the idea and making it more simple.

Overall Kotlin was the coolest language I learned so far.
I liked python a little bit better than Java but Kotlin was the perfect middle ground of the two.
